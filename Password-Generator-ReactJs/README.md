# Password Generator Project

This project is a password generator built with React and Vite, providing a minimal setup with hot module replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules to maintain code quality.

## Features

- Generate passwords with custom length
- Option to include numbers and special characters
- Responsive design
- Copy generated password to clipboard
- Clear and simple UI

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- npm (version 6 or later)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-generator.git
   cd password-generator
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server and you can access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build will be output to the `dist` directory.

### Linting

To run ESLint:

```bash
npm run lint
```

This will check the code for any linting errors based on the ESLint rules specified.

## Usage

1. Set the desired length of the password using the range input.
2. Toggle the checkboxes to include numbers and special characters in the password.
3. Click the "Copy" button to copy the generated password to your clipboard.
